    "### Data Analysis and Conclusion\n",
    "A conclusion I can draw from my data analysis is that there is a big difference between the largest and smallest salaries. There is about a 132 dollar difference between the min and max salary. The reasoning behind this could be due to many of the following factors: the level of the job, number of hours worked, and the type of job. This data raises many questions. Some of them being: Is there a minimum wage for high school interns? Is there a minimum wage for those who work part time compared to those who work full time?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data also posed questions towards the validity and legitamacy of the data collection. Some being: Are there any flaws in the data? Have any salaries changed since the data was updated last? Are the uploaded salaries pre-tax collection or post-tax collection? It would be interesting to dive deeper into this data set, since it is relevant to our environment as we are living in/near Seattle. "
